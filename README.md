# Covid-Data-Analysis

For the analysis the original dataset which was extracted in excel sheets was divided into two parts:
1. Dataset containing Covid Active Cases, New Cases and Mortality records across various measures.
2. Dataset containing Covid Vaccination records across various measures.

For this project Relational Database Management System, SQL Server is used to import dataset from excel file and conduct analysis using SQL queries to questions such as:
- Continents with Total Infected Cases.
- Continents with Mortality Percentage w.r.t to infected cases on time basis and demographic wise.
- Percentage Vaccinated per location w.r.t their population.
- Countries with total vaccinnation more than 100 million.
- Getting Countries where vaccination haven't started yet.
- And many more.

The analysis is conducted using various SQL function such concept of Joins, CTEs, Unions and many more, while analysing the dataset it was also observed that some of the records of our interest were having NULL values, so filtering out those records was also been performed for correct analysis.
